# Auto Data Scraper

This script scrapes car data for every make and model found on the website https://www.auto-data.net/en/. I have not been able to find a reliable source 
of car specs data anywhere and wanted to be able to analyze performance (HP, torque, 0-60 times, etc.) across makes and models. 

Please note that the website creators may change the layout over time, so adjustments might have to be made to the code in order to reach the desired result.
